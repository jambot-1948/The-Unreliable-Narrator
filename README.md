**[View V1 (Original) →](https://jambot-1948.github.io/The-Unreliable-Narrator/)** | **[View V2 (Enhanced) →](https://jambot-1948.github.io/The-Unreliable-Narrator-v2/)**

A cinematic scroll experience exploring how engineering artifacts — dashboards, pipelines, roadmaps, and KPIs — act as unreliable narrators, producing confidence without shared reality.

## The Premise

In literature, an unreliable narrator tells a story they believe is true, but their perspective is limited by what they don't know. At work, our artifacts are narrators too. They tell coherent stories. But coherence is not the same thing as truth.
